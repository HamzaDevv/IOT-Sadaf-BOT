*   **Neutrals:** Classic neutrals like navy, gray, and white are always a safe bet and can be paired with brighter colors for a pop.

Here are a few specific outfit ideas:

*   **Casual:** A navy blue t-shirt with khaki chinos and white sneakers.
*   **Semi-Formal:** A button-down shirt in a shade of olive green or mustard yellow, paired with dark wash jeans or dress pants.
